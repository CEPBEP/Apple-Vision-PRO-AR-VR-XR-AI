# Apply for Unity Polyspatial Beta
[https://create.unity.com/spatial](https://create.unity.com/spatial)
UNITY’S BETA PROGRAM FOR CREATING SPATIAL EXPERIENCES
Get started with spatial creation
Be the first to create for Apple’s visionOS platform
Unity is excited to collaborate with Apple to bring familiar and powerful authoring tools for creating immersive games and apps for this new spatial computing platform, Apple Vision Pro. Your apps will get access to benefits such as pass-through and Dynamic Foveated Rendering, in addition to popular Unity features like AR Foundation and XR Interaction Toolkit.

## VisionOS
![VisionOS Interface](https://www.apple.com/visionos/interface.jpg)  
The operating system for Apple Vision Pro. Use visionOS with familiar tools to build immersive apps and games.

### Features
- Windows: Create with SwiftUI, add 3D content.
- Volumes: Use RealityKit or Unity for 3D experiences.
- Spaces: Shared Space for side-by-side apps, Full Space for immersive experiences.

**Developing for visionOS**: Requires a Mac with Apple silicon.  
[Get started with visionOS](https://www.apple.com/visionos/get-started)

[Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos#Overview)
Developing for visionOS requires a Mac with Apple silicon. Create new apps using SwiftUI to take full advantage of the spectrum of immersion available in visionOS. If you have an existing iPad or iPhone app, add the visionOS destination to your app’s target to gain access to the standard system appearance, and add platform-specific features to create a compelling experience. To provide continuous access to your content in the meantime, deliver a compatible version of your app that runs in visionOS.

[Expand your app into immersive spaces](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos#Expand-your-app-into-immersive-spaces)
Start with a familiar window-based experience to introduce people to your content. From there, add [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI) scene types specific to visionOS, such as volumes and spaces. These scene types let you incorporate depth, 3D objects, and immersive experiences.

Build your app’s 3D content with [RealityKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit) and Reality Composer Pro, and display it with a [RealityView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/RealityView). In an immersive experience, use [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit) to integrate your content with the person’s surroundings.

## [Explore new kinds of interaction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos#Explore-new-kinds-of-interaction)
People can select an element by looking at it and tapping their fingers together. They can also pinch, drag, zoom, and rotate objects using specific hand gestures. [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI) provides built-in support for these standard gestures, so rely on them for most of your app’s input. When you want to go beyond the standard gestures, use [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit) to create custom gestures.
